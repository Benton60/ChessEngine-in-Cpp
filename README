Chess Engine For C++ Final Project
By Benton Hershberger, William Walline


Note 1:
    None of the classes have getters or setters because that adds one layer of abstraction. Normally the safety
    that ensures is worth the nanoseconds of delay it creates but in the case of a chess engine where efficiency is
    so critical we must leave them out.



Piece values:
    (Sub-Note 1: These values are based off of relative piece worth. EX: a queen is worth nine pawns)
    (Sub-Note 2: The black piece values are the same as the white pieces just multiplied by negative one)

    King - 10000   //I just picked a really big number so that it favors the king more than other pieces
    Queen - 900
    Rook - 500
    Bishop - 350
    Knight - 300
    Pawn - 100
